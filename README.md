<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Tatiana Belova</h1>
<h3 align="center">A junior QA / QC from Russia</h3>

Hi, my name is Tatiana. I have two diplomas in construction, but I have always been interested in IT and have been learning QA on my own. I have also had experience in testing projects at previous jobs. I want to develop and learn new things, but I felt that engineering lacked modern approaches such as automation and more modern project file and documentation management, so it didn't suit me.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **Tomat.ai** and studying.

ðŸ“« Reach me out in TG **@eviltanch1k** or by **eviltanch1k@gmail.com**
